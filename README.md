These are google colab notebook.
you can find dataset for them in another repository:dataset-used-for-machine-learning
one data set for credit card fraud prediction can be downloaded from kaggle.com and extracted to be used as data set
Edit:
1)Breast cancer recognition using 
2)Boardgame review prediction
3)Credit card fraud detection
4)Stock market clustering using kmeans clustering
5)Diabetes onset prediction using deep learning with densenet
6)Object recognition on CIFAR10 dataset using the ALL-CNN-C midel from striving for simplicity paper
7)Object recognition on imagenet dataset using pretrained model VGG16
